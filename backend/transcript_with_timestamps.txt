[0.00 --> 5.68]  see it. There we go. There you are. All right, everybody wave high to Robert.
[7.68 --> 15.28]  Okay. Awesome. Awesome. So, you ready to get started, Robert? You ready for this man? You
[15.28 --> 23.20]  excited? Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I'm interested to see who's joining us in the chat today.
[23.20 --> 34.16]  I see Zoro. I see Joey, Picks, Mindy, Nicholas, Tray, Erica. We have some really great people
[34.16 --> 39.84]  here. And I hope you guys are excited because tonight we're going to be doing something
[39.84 --> 46.40]  really special. So, tonight, as I said, we're going to be unlocking the secrets to social
[46.40 --> 52.96]  mastery to allow you to discover how to read people at a higher level. And I want to open up with
[52.96 --> 58.80]  our first question and we're going to bounce this over to you, Robert. Why is it so important
[58.80 --> 64.24]  for us to understand the subject matter that we're going to be talking about today?
[65.60 --> 70.00]  Well, thank you for having me burning and thank you to everybody out there. I'm kind of
[70.00 --> 73.76]  humble to see all these names from all these different places. It's pretty amazing.
[74.96 --> 81.60]  Anyway, the reason I did this master class for mentor show is because from all my experience,
[82.40 --> 88.64]  all of us humans, we suffer. We have pain in our lives. We have anxiety. We have tension.
[88.96 --> 95.44]  We feel frustrated. But we often don't realize the source of our problems, the source of this
[95.44 --> 101.44]  tension and the same anxiety and this pain. And I maintain that as a social animal, a lot of our
[101.44 --> 107.04]  problems stem from the fact that we really, really don't truly understand the people around us.
[107.52 --> 112.64]  You could be married to the same person for 10, 20 years. And there's still things about them
[112.64 --> 119.76]  that you don't understand. People are a mystery. They wear masks. They learn very early age.
[119.76 --> 126.24]  How to hide certain things that they don't want other people to see. And so, I say let's
[126.24 --> 131.12]  imagine, for instance, that you could see into the person that you're dealing with, you had
[131.12 --> 136.80]  100% clarity about them. You could see them and understand them perfectly. Now, that is an
[136.80 --> 142.32]  ideal and that is basically impossible. But that if we say that's like at 100%,
[143.04 --> 149.28]  most of us are understanding of people is more in the area of four or five percent. We're very
[149.28 --> 155.12]  self absorbed. We're locked in our phones. We're thinking of our own problems. We're not really
[155.12 --> 160.00]  deeply engaging with people. We're not really looking at them. We're not really observing them.
[160.64 --> 166.32]  And the point of the master class that I did the mentor show is to be it, to give you the
[166.32 --> 173.84]  power to raise that up to 20, 30, 40, 50%. So you have the power to move people in the direction you
[173.84 --> 180.40]  want. So that you don't say things that inadvertently insult people and cause all kinds of tensions
[180.40 --> 185.92]  and problems that you don't inadvertently get yourself fired for doing things that are socially
[185.92 --> 192.16]  awkward, etc. So that you realize that being a social animal is a skill and you raise that
[192.24 --> 198.48]  skill to a high enough level where you don't have all of this drama in here. You don't have all of
[198.48 --> 204.96]  this tension and you can focus on things that are actually truly important. So that is the point
[204.96 --> 210.24]  of this master class that I created and of the mentor show and of what we're talking about today.
[211.12 --> 218.08]  Awesome. Thank you so much Robert for sharing that. I just want to jump back to the presentation here.
[218.56 --> 224.08]  And I want to share with you guys what we're going to be covering today as the agenda. So here's
[224.08 --> 228.24]  what we're going to talk about and what you can expect. We're going to talk about how to see
[228.24 --> 233.68]  through the mass people where we're going to talk about how to deal with toxic people. We're also
[233.68 --> 239.44]  going to be talking about how to seduce an influence anyone, which is really cool. And this is probably
[239.44 --> 244.40]  the most, I think this is what's got me most excited Robert. Is that you're going to be doing
[244.40 --> 253.76]  a live Q&A with us here and that's just powerful man. Okay. I'm ready. Awesome. Okay. Cool. So a
[253.76 --> 259.60]  couple of things housekeeping before we get into the content for the people who don't know what
[259.60 --> 266.24]  mentor show is. Maybe you've never heard about us. We are a platform that has 30 plus master classes

[314.56 --> 321.28]  slash EN and yeah, that's where you can find out more about what we do. So Robert, now that we got
[321.28 --> 327.68]  the housekeeping out of the way, let's talk about part one. Let's just really go into this and
[327.68 --> 335.28]  talk about how to see through the mass. So I'm going to pop you up over here again and I'm going
[335.28 --> 341.20]  to start with this question, Robert. Like what advice would you give someone who really wants to
[341.20 --> 348.96]  understand people for who they really are, what they're really like? Well, the first step and the
[348.96 --> 353.92]  most important one is to realize that you don't really understand people that you're misleading them.
[354.88 --> 360.00]  And the thing that you tend to do is you tend to project your own emotions onto them. You tend to see
[360.00 --> 365.76]  them through the lens of your own desires. You want you whether you like them or whether you don't like them.
[365.76 --> 371.92]  And things that haven't in the past, your parents, your past relationships, all of the troubles
[371.92 --> 377.12]  that you've had in life. And so when you're looking at this person that you're dealing with in your work,
[377.12 --> 382.80]  in your relationships, even your children, you're projecting onto them, these images that are inside
[382.88 --> 388.08]  your own head that have nothing to do with the reality. So the first step is to tell yourself,
[389.12 --> 395.68]  I don't really understand this person that I'm dealing with. They are a meh, to me. So you want
[395.68 --> 400.72]  to wipe the sleep clean and you want to try and observe them, but you have to be able to calm
[400.72 --> 406.72]  all of your emotional responses down, even your desires to like a person. You have to stop that
[406.72 --> 412.24]  and you have to try and find a neutral position where you're just observing them for who they are,
[412.80 --> 419.44]  they have their own life, their own dreams, their own crumbs, their own faults. And you want to be
[419.44 --> 426.48]  able to see them and you want to have access to them. The second thing you understand is that you
[426.48 --> 433.20]  tend to judge people based on their appearances, how they look to you, what they say, you tend to
[433.20 --> 440.08]  focus so much on their words, right? But we all know that words can be very slippery. People can say
[440.08 --> 445.52]  whatever they want to say. They can say, I love your screenplay. I think your ideas are brilliant,
[445.52 --> 452.64]  but they don't mean it at all. Anybody can say what they want. And so you tend to value the appearance
[452.64 --> 457.60]  as you tend to value what you see and how people look, how people look and how they appear.
[457.60 --> 463.04]  And this can be very tricky and very deceptive. So the most important thing that you can do is to
[463.04 --> 468.48]  realize that the appearance, the surface, the faces that you see are not the reality.
[470.08 --> 476.80]  Or hiding something. And so your task as a social being, as a social animal, trying to improve
[476.80 --> 484.80]  your level of skill is to see past those appearances, see past those masks that people wear. And
[484.80 --> 491.92]  one of the things you have to realize is that people have a character. They have something deep inside
[491.92 --> 497.84]  that motivates them that makes them do the things that they do. And this character is in things
[497.84 --> 503.36]  that they can't even control. It has to do with genetics, it has to do with their early childhood,
[503.36 --> 510.56]  it has to do with things that are not visible to you. Right? So you want to judge them. And so
[511.28 --> 518.24]  one thing that happens is when people are in stressful situations, for instance, that mask tends
[518.24 --> 524.40]  to come off. And you see some of the true person behind that. How they handle stress,
[525.36 --> 528.64]  reveals something about what's going on.
[528.64 --> 532.64]  .
[545.04 --> 545.84]  .
[545.84 --> 552.32]  They're often hiding the exact opposite. They've developed from childhood, they desire to
[552.32 --> 559.20]  hide the fact that they're actually very shy, they're very timid, they're very insecure.
[559.20 --> 565.76]  And so they put on this front of being super confident. And actually the truth is the opposite.
[565.76 --> 572.56]  So you want to be able to see these very overt traits that people have in realize that that is a mask
[573.68 --> 580.56]  that happen are how to when people are given power, how do they handle that power?
[580.64 --> 588.16]  Suddenly they become very mean-spirited, very cruel to other people. That's revealing who they
[588.16 --> 593.60]  are behind the mask. As they're rising up in the company or wherever, they tend to be the court
[593.60 --> 599.52]  chair, they be smiling and be friendly. And then as soon as they reach a position of power, that mask
[599.52 --> 605.04]  comes off. And they reveal that they're actually somebody very different. The other thing you want to
[605.04 --> 613.68]  see, which will reveal about people, who they are truly, is criticizing them. How do they take criticism?
[613.68 --> 619.92]  A lot of people can't take criticism on any level. And you certainly don't want to ever hire people
[619.92 --> 626.24]  or be in a relationship with people who cannot take any kind of criticism. That reveals
[626.24 --> 633.68]  deep, deep levels of insecurity and anxiety. And so, but they're hiding it in some way. And so that
[633.76 --> 640.16]  mask comes off when you criticize them. And they be taking things everything so personally. I know
[640.48 --> 647.20]  when I was working, when I hire a systems, I often give them a test. And I try and criticize
[647.20 --> 653.28]  that a work on some level and say, I don't do it meanly, I don't do it harshly, I do it gently, but I say,
[653.28 --> 658.64]  you know, this is something that you're doing that's wrong. And how they respond to that reveals
[658.64 --> 662.96]  to me, who they really are. They're trying to pretend they're something. They're trying to pretend
[663.04 --> 667.36]  that they're very efficient that they love me, et cetera. But when I criticize them,
[667.36 --> 673.44]  that mask tends to come off. So, these are some of the ways you can probe and test who people really are.
[674.16 --> 679.52]  And in the master class that I did, I have many, many more ideas about how to pierce and see
[679.52 --> 685.52]  behind these masks that people have. Yeah, that's, that's a super powerful one. I think that
[685.92 --> 692.16]  anybody, by a show of hand, just by dropping guesses in the chat, like, have you guys
[692.16 --> 698.00]  experience some of that, right? Like, have you seen how people respond, like, maybe a boss at work
[698.00 --> 703.28]  or a colleague, as they're rising up the ranks, you know, they treat people better, you know,
[703.28 --> 708.08]  like things like that, does anybody relate to that just by raising your hand? Because I know I can
[708.08 --> 715.28]  rather than that's one of the things that stuck out to me. I would like to also kind of,
[716.64 --> 721.92]  shift gears a little bit. And I think this is a good time to move into our next topic,
[722.88 --> 727.44]  unless there's anything else that you wanted to cover there. But I'm just curious in the chat also,
[729.44 --> 736.08]  like, when we're dealing with people in the world a lot of times, we come across these people that
[736.08 --> 742.00]  may not be good people, right? Like, I think you define them as like toxic personalities, and that's what
[742.00 --> 746.96]  we've defined them in society. Like, so I'd like to transition to, to that piece.
[747.92 --> 753.28]  I mean, just jump back over here to the presentation because I think this is pretty powerful. And this is
[753.92 --> 758.32]  this is where part two will come in ladies and gentlemen, and how to deal with these people,
[758.32 --> 763.76]  because we're coming in contact with these people on a regular basis, Robert, and I think it would
[763.76 --> 768.56]  be really helpful for the people in the audience to understand, you know, how to deal with them,
[768.56 --> 774.72]  which brings me to my next question because in the master class, I know you talk about, just,
[774.80 --> 783.04]  you talk about dealing with toxic personalities. So how do we recognize these types of people
[783.04 --> 790.48]  in our everyday situations? Well, I have a very simple way of reading whether people are truly
[790.48 --> 796.80]  toxic. Now, there's, let's say that there are toxic narcissists out there. We all have narcissistic
[796.80 --> 802.16]  tendencies where all self-absorbed, but some people are toxic narcissists. There are people who
[802.24 --> 807.04]  have toxic envy. We're all subject to feeling envy, but there's some people who carry to
[807.04 --> 812.32]  it toxic level. Passive aggression is something we share, but there are people out there who are
[812.32 --> 819.76]  toxicly passive aggressive. And the way that recognize them is simple, they tend to occupy
[819.76 --> 827.68]  a lot of mental space in your head, thinking about them. They're churning up all of these emotions,
[827.76 --> 838.00]  and most of these emotions are negative, fear, anxiety, resentment, frustration, confusion,
[838.00 --> 844.96]  guilt. Occasionally, there might be a positive emotion put in there because sometimes these people
[844.96 --> 850.48]  are good at playing push-and-plull games where they inject a little bit of affection to get you hooked,
[850.48 --> 856.80]  then they pull back. But overall, you can recognize them by the fact that most of the emotions
[856.88 --> 862.40]  they turn up are negative, and they absorb so much of your mental space so that when they're not
[862.40 --> 868.16]  around when you're not dealing with them, you're thinking about them. And I compare the mind to
[868.16 --> 875.60]  like a house. You've invited these people into your house and they won't leave. They're in your
[875.60 --> 880.00]  bedroom, they're in your living room. They just take in residents, they're in your can't get rid of them.
[880.00 --> 886.24]  Okay? So they're occupying your brain when you don't want them to. That's how you recognize
[886.32 --> 891.92]  any kind of talks of person. But the most important thing for you to understand is
[891.92 --> 897.12]  they're playing games to get you emotionally involved to trigger you, to get inside if you
[897.12 --> 902.56]  to get you, to get their hooks in you. The best thing you can do is to recognize them
[902.56 --> 906.96]  before they are able to do that, before they enter your house and take residents in your head.
[907.60 --> 912.32]  If you can do that, then you can control your emotions. You can get rid of them, or you can
[912.32 --> 918.16]  not have a relation with ship with them, or you can be relatively objective and unemotional in
[918.16 --> 924.40]  dealing with them. But once they have their hooks in you, once that toxic narcissist has been
[924.40 --> 931.04]  able to get inside of your life and get all these little dramas going on, it's very, very
[931.04 --> 937.84]  difficult to disconnect. So the most important thing is to recognize them. And in the master class,
[938.08 --> 943.92]  I give you some clues as to, for example, how do it see those toxic narcissists in our life?
[943.92 --> 948.00]  I mean, I could talk about all the other types, but just to focus on the toxic narcissist,
[948.00 --> 953.60]  which is the main type that we deal with, particularly in the world today. And the thing you must
[953.60 --> 960.00]  understand is that a lot of toxic narcissists can rise to positions of power. And why is that?
[960.00 --> 964.72]  Because you would think that because they're so self-absorbed, they would never be able to become
[964.72 --> 971.36]  like a CEO. But people like Elon Musk and I'm not judging him as as a business person,
[971.36 --> 979.28]  but he is very, very narcissistic and he's very, very powerful. The reason is these types of people
[979.28 --> 985.84]  from early on in life have learned how to be very charming, how to be very dramatic. They're very
[985.84 --> 992.96]  theatrical types of people. And you look at the surfaces I said earlier on, you get too much
[992.96 --> 997.84]  wrapped up in people's appearance. They look dramatic. They look exciting. They look confident.
[998.24 --> 1002.32]  And then you get involved with them. You work for them. You have a relationship with them. And
[1002.32 --> 1007.84]  slowly, you realize that they don't care at all about you. They're simply using you as a pond.
[1009.36 --> 1015.92]  So some of the signs of a toxic narcissist is that they're as they're very theatrical. The other
[1015.92 --> 1024.24]  sign is if you do something, if you insult them in some way, or if you say if you resist them in
[1024.24 --> 1030.32]  some way, they go into what's called toxic rage. They cannot handle any kind of criticism because
[1030.32 --> 1037.60]  they have this deep insecurity and emptiness inside. And so if you trigger any kind of negative
[1037.60 --> 1044.88]  feeling on their part, they will explode into this rage. The other thing I tell people is we didn't
[1044.96 --> 1052.72]  talk about non-verbal communication. And in the mentor class, the mentor show that I do, I focus a lot
[1053.68 --> 1059.44]  a non-verbal communication because it's extremely revealing about people and about who they are.
[1060.24 --> 1067.68]  And toxic narcissists, I, in my experience, have this one very common trait, which is when they're
[1067.68 --> 1073.28]  looking at you, they appear to be interested in excited, but you'll notice that their eyes are kind
[1073.36 --> 1079.68]  of dead. They're not really excited. They're not really interested in you. People who are interested
[1079.68 --> 1084.88]  in you who like you, who love you, who want to be involved with you, who are not using you. Their
[1084.88 --> 1090.72]  faces animated when they look at you, their eyes are open. But when you look at it at a toxic narcissist,
[1090.72 --> 1096.72]  and I've noticed this time again, is their eyes kind of blank, it's kind of dead. They may smile,
[1096.72 --> 1101.84]  but they're not really looking at you. They're looking at you as an object that they can use
[1101.92 --> 1107.44]  for their own purposes. And so these are some of the powerful ways, but the most important thing
[1107.44 --> 1112.80]  is to not get involved with these people, learn the basics of recognizing
[1113.76 --> 1120.88]  envies, people, enviers tend to be among your friends. So one way of seeing a person who's got toxic
[1120.88 --> 1127.68]  envies, they're in a rush to befriends you. You meet them and then three days later, they're
[1127.68 --> 1132.32]  your best friend. They want to know everything about you. They're texting you all the time.
[1132.32 --> 1138.56]  They love you. They think you're great. Now that's not a normal human pattern of behavior.
[1138.56 --> 1144.72]  Most of us are kind of a little bit tentative when we first meet somebody. This is a classic sign of
[1144.72 --> 1151.04]  somebody who's getting close to you in order to hurt you in order because they envy you in some way.
[1151.04 --> 1157.20]  So in the class, I have many, many other more tips about how to recognize these people. So you
[1157.20 --> 1164.80]  don't let them into your house before it's too late. Yeah, I was reflecting on it because I've
[1164.80 --> 1170.00]  gone through the masterclass and I feel like you did an amazing job with identifying those people
[1170.00 --> 1175.84]  because we're going to come up against them in a lot of times. We just can't avoid them.
[1176.48 --> 1180.96]  We're going to come, we can't avoid not coming in contact with them, but this gives us a nice
[1180.96 --> 1184.72]  framework to just figure out who they are and run in the other direction.
[1187.92 --> 1195.28]  So I'm curious for the people in the audience, is there anyone who wants to learn how to build
[1195.28 --> 1201.92]  better relationships, wants to learn how to influence people? Because I think this is a,
[1201.92 --> 1206.32]  and just to kind of conclude Robert, I think from here, what I'm here and you say is like
[1206.40 --> 1212.72]  recognize that the narcissist, they're, the root of how they grew up and they're upbringing
[1212.72 --> 1218.64]  has taught them this way of manipulating people and they're, when they hook into you, you know,
[1218.64 --> 1223.76]  they basically can, that's when they latch into you and they suck you dry and then the person who
[1223.76 --> 1228.80]  envies you, they're trying to get close to you so they can manipulate you and do all that stuff.
[1228.80 --> 1232.56]  Am I on the right track? Yes, we are. And the thing is, talks people,
[1233.44 --> 1238.80]  don't wear a little sign on their head saying, I'm toxic. They've learned very early age to
[1238.80 --> 1244.64]  hide it, to hide it behind of the near, of being charming, of being friendly, of being likable,
[1244.64 --> 1250.64]  etc. And so it's very, very tricky because you can't recognize them, you can't find see them
[1250.64 --> 1254.96]  just based on how they look at you based on their appearances. You have to be able to look
[1254.96 --> 1266.08]  behind them and see the reality. Yeah, totally. So I want to go to our next segment here and part
[1266.08 --> 1274.40]  three of this is how to seduce and influence anyone. And this is, I think this is pretty powerful because
[1275.68 --> 1279.04]  you know, and I'd like to get your take on this because I think when people hear seduction,
[1279.04 --> 1284.80]  they kind of like think of it as like a sexual thing or trying to coerce. But I know that you
[1285.76 --> 1291.36]  there's more to this, right? And I'd like to dig into that. But this is part three. So we'll dive into
[1291.36 --> 1298.88]  this. And let me just go back here to get you on the screen. But like let's talk about this, Robert.
[1298.88 --> 1306.48]  So how can seduction and influence be used to get what we want? And how can people think about this
[1306.48 --> 1313.68]  in a different way than it just being like this thing related to like sexual stuff? Well,
[1315.12 --> 1319.92]  it is some of seduction is definitely sexual and I don't want to deny that. And I talked about that
[1319.92 --> 1327.12]  a little bit in the mentor's class show. I mean, there are people we are situations where we do want
[1327.12 --> 1332.40]  to seduce a man or a woman. So I don't want to run away from that. Sure. But seduction is much
[1332.40 --> 1338.80]  larger than that. And the issue really is how to influence people, how to persuade them. You can't
[1338.80 --> 1344.48]  get through this life. If you don't have the ability to somehow get people on your side to move
[1344.64 --> 1350.16]  them to like your ideas, to want to move in your direction, to not hurt your harm you. And you
[1350.16 --> 1355.76]  have to understand that people are naturally resistant to anything that you want from them.
[1355.76 --> 1361.20]  They're even naturally resistant, obviously, in any kind of sexual seduction. And the whole
[1361.20 --> 1369.04]  game is to lower their resistances, right? And people, particularly in the world today, I hate to judge,
[1369.12 --> 1374.80]  are actually not very good at this. The main thing that you want to be able to be a better
[1374.80 --> 1381.84]  seduce or to be a better influence or in life is the power to get outside of yourself. We are so
[1381.84 --> 1387.92]  self absorbed and to the degree that you enter into the world, the mindset of that other person.
[1387.92 --> 1393.84]  You get inside their skin, you understand their values, you understand how they think. And what they
[1393.84 --> 1399.60]  want, you will have much greater power to move them in the direction that you want. You will be
[1399.60 --> 1407.12]  able to lower their resistances. So I talk in the class about having deep levels of empathy,
[1407.12 --> 1412.24]  where you actually enter their world completely and you understand where they're coming from.
[1412.24 --> 1417.04]  And what their childhood was like and what were the traumas in their life, etc.
[1417.04 --> 1422.64]  Creating that connection of deep levels of empathy will make the other person fall under your
[1422.64 --> 1428.64]  spell and will create a very deep connection between you. The other thing I talk about is how to
[1428.64 --> 1436.00]  validate their egos. We go through life and nobody. We think of ourselves as great usually,
[1436.00 --> 1441.44]  we do unless we have very little empathy. Wow, I'm just a wonderful person. I'm so smart,
[1441.44 --> 1448.40]  I have the best values, you know, on and on and on. But the true validation that we really create
[1448.40 --> 1454.48]  comes from other people, other people telling us, yes, Robert, you are actually smart. Yes,
[1454.48 --> 1460.72]  you are actually a good person. That is the validation people crave. You need to be able to give them
[1460.72 --> 1467.12]  that validation to show them that you think that they are actually a really good person,
[1467.12 --> 1473.36]  that they're even smarter than you are. Right? One of the laws of power and the 48 laws of power is
[1473.44 --> 1483.52]  a pure, dumber than others, you know, and the idea that you're insulting people's intelligence
[1483.52 --> 1491.44]  is incredibly dangerous and incredibly anti-seduction. So you want to validate people in the things
[1491.44 --> 1498.48]  that matter most to them in their egos. And then you want to realize that how you look at people,
[1498.56 --> 1505.20]  how your attitude is towards them, how you think about them, has an infecting power. If you go
[1505.20 --> 1511.28]  up to somebody in a party or any kind of event like that and you're already thinking negative
[1511.28 --> 1516.88]  thoughts about them or you're not insecure, they pick that up, they sense it, and they respond to
[1516.88 --> 1523.84]  you in a defensive negative way. And I want to train you to go up to people even those that you
[1523.84 --> 1530.16]  don't like and just tell yourself, actually I like you, actually I think you're an interesting
[1530.16 --> 1536.80]  person. You don't say any of that, you just think it. You're attitude infects them with a particular
[1536.80 --> 1543.20]  quality and it opens them up to you. So it's a very powerful technique. And finally, there comes
[1543.20 --> 1550.72]  seduction and seduction is basically the ability to give people pleasure in life. None of us
[1550.80 --> 1556.08]  in the world today because we're so politically correct because we're so tight in our bodies.
[1556.08 --> 1562.08]  We don't have enough pleasure. We don't have enough adventure. We're actually craving seduction.
[1563.04 --> 1567.68]  People may not say that, they may say, oh seduction is evil. Or Robert Green is evil.
[1567.68 --> 1573.76]  Oh, the art of seduction is a bad book. But secretly, they want it, they crave it because all of us
[1573.76 --> 1579.36]  want to be taken out of ourselves. We want to be taken on the adventure. And so you have to be able,
[1579.44 --> 1586.56]  so you have to understand that that is the power that you have. But what I talk about in that
[1586.56 --> 1591.76]  and that particular segment is if you two obvious, if it's too clear that you're trying to
[1591.76 --> 1598.16]  seduce people, if you two cold and manipulative, they can sense it. So you have to disguise yourself.
[1598.16 --> 1605.36]  You have to peer natural. It can bake. It has to actually be something, but everybody has seductive
[1605.36 --> 1612.48]  qualities. And so the idea is you want to be a seduce or in life. And you want to be able to seduce
[1612.48 --> 1618.08]  people even in the office, whether it's an absolutely no sexual element to them. But the sense
[1618.08 --> 1624.88]  that you're a charming person, that you like them, and that you are to know you,
[1624.88 --> 1629.92]  is going to be an exciting adventure that there's some mystery about you being a seduction.
[1629.92 --> 1636.56]  It involves a lot of creating mystery. It's very, very powerful. So just imagine if this way,
[1636.56 --> 1642.48]  you're dealing with people on all levels and you're lowering their resistance, you're lowering
[1642.48 --> 1647.92]  their defensiveness. They have walls and you're breaking through those walls and they're falling
[1647.92 --> 1652.72]  under your spell. And that's what I'm discussing in that part of the mentor show and go into great
[1653.20 --> 1659.84]  depth. Yeah. And this is super powerful for me, Robert, because being an entrepreneur,
[1661.68 --> 1667.28]  you have to go out and you have to sell. So part of, I look at the seduction as the stuff that I've
[1667.28 --> 1672.08]  learned from you, I look at me seducing someone is like, that's making the sale. It's getting them
[1672.08 --> 1678.16]  to buy into my ideas and to even want a sales call. I'm going in and I have to lower their resistance.
[1678.16 --> 1682.24]  Right. So that to me, that's how I think about seduction. Would you say that's in line?
[1682.24 --> 1689.44]  Yes, very much. So just think of it this way. To the degree that you enter into their world,
[1689.44 --> 1695.04]  that you think of their needs, their interests, their desires, you become a much better sales person
[1695.04 --> 1701.36]  on any level. And whether it's in personal relationships or whatever. But the worst kind of sales
[1701.36 --> 1706.32]  mirror those that have their own kind of speel in their head and they're thinking about how great
[1706.40 --> 1710.56]  their product is and they're trying to sell it to you. And you're just like, man, I don't
[1710.56 --> 1714.96]  I don't want to hear you tune them out because we hear so many people trying to sell those things.
[1715.92 --> 1720.08]  But if they think it through and they go, this is an individual I'm dealing with.
[1720.56 --> 1726.40]  This is some of their needs, their world, their problems. I'm going to appeal to their self-interest.
[1726.40 --> 1733.44]  I'm going to appeal to what they need in life. Suddenly, doors open up. I know personally,
[1733.52 --> 1741.60]  for instance, in my own life, I never, ever have enough time. I'm so busy and it drives me crazy.
[1741.60 --> 1750.16]  If somebody entered my life, somehow promising the prospect of saving me time, I would melt in front
[1750.16 --> 1757.60]  of them. The way it's to sell me, whatever it is, right? But people come to me and they don't think
[1757.60 --> 1762.56]  that that's, you know, I get requests all of the time where people want to be my apprentice,
[1763.52 --> 1769.44]  it's said, you know, any kind of function with me or partner with me, they don't think of that.
[1769.44 --> 1775.60]  They don't realize how busy I am, but everybody is super busy. So being able to pierce inside the
[1775.60 --> 1781.76]  world of the other person to go, what is their need? Not my need, what is their need? What are their
[1781.76 --> 1786.80]  secret desires? That is the secret to any kind of sale or any kind of seduction.
[1787.68 --> 1793.52]  Love it. Powerful. I think speaking of these, I think this is a perfect time to transition to talk
[1793.52 --> 1799.36]  about the master class and how it could help our audience here at a deeper level. And
[1799.36 --> 1804.48]  in everyone, I'm acknowledging, I want to acknowledge that I see a lot of questions in the chat and
[1805.20 --> 1809.92]  make sure you guys keep putting those in the chat. We're going to feel those at the end. For those of
[1809.92 --> 1814.16]  you who didn't hear at the beginning, Robert's going to stick around and do a Q&A. So you'll
[1814.24 --> 1818.80]  guys will want to make sure you stay to the very end. So put all those questions there. Quick
[1818.80 --> 1824.88]  question for you, Robert. I know we talked about a lot and we're covering a lot here. And, you know,
[1825.60 --> 1831.12]  there's probably people that want to go deeper, right? If people want this stuff to sink in,
[1831.12 --> 1836.96]  how can your master class really help us get to the root and really make this a practice for us?
[1838.32 --> 1843.20]  Well, a lot of what's in this master class is based on the laws of human nature,
[1843.84 --> 1850.80]  which you've you delved into, it is a 580 page book. It's very dense. Okay, I have tried to
[1850.80 --> 1857.20]  simplify it on some level and give you the basic ideas that are contained in that book.
[1857.20 --> 1862.08]  Very concentrated. It's like a straight shot of whiskey that I'm giving you. There's no one.
[1862.64 --> 1868.00]  Ice, it's just the whiskey. So you're getting the straight material right there. And I'm trying
[1868.00 --> 1874.24]  to make it very practical. It's not abstract. It's not me intellectualizing and going on and on about
[1874.24 --> 1880.64]  psychology. It's about your life, the problems that you're dealing with. And so I'm trying to train
[1880.64 --> 1887.52]  you in this art of dealing with people on a higher level. I have exercises, which is something that I didn't
[1887.52 --> 1893.92]  have in laws of human nature. I worked very, very hard to put this mentor show together. I put a
[1893.92 --> 1901.76]  lot of thought in it. And I thought of exercises that can help you realize these ideas in your own life.
[1901.76 --> 1907.68]  You know, how to observe people in your everyday life exercise about that, how to control your
[1907.68 --> 1913.36]  emotions so that talks that people don't get under your skin, how to alter the people that you're
[1913.36 --> 1918.56]  dealing with through your attitude, through how you think of them on and on. So these exercises are
[1918.72 --> 1926.56]  very focused. It's a very focused mentor, class, ship, class on how to understand people and deal
[1926.56 --> 1933.84]  with them in great detail. Okay. So there's not a lot of abstract stuff. There are stories in there,
[1933.84 --> 1940.08]  but the stories are a lot of it for my own life or from a couple of stories in the laws of human
[1940.08 --> 1945.28]  nature, but they're very direct and they're very applicable and they're very relevant. So it's a
[1945.28 --> 1953.12]  extremely practical show. I personally believe that combined with the laws of human nature,
[1953.76 --> 1959.84]  reading the book and doing the master class, it will really benefit the most. But that is the idea
[1959.84 --> 1966.96]  behind my what I craft for this. Beautiful. Man, I'm going to need the help of everybody in the audience
[1966.96 --> 1972.64]  today. I want you guys to get super hyped for this one because we have something amazingly special
[1972.72 --> 1980.48]  for you guys today. So just by show a hand in the chat right now, I want you guys to tell me
[1981.52 --> 1988.88]  who wants to discover Robert Green's method for gaining power to see people as they are. Drop
[1988.88 --> 1995.28]  a meet in the chat right now. Light it up, light it up. Let me see who's ready for this because this
[1995.28 --> 2002.40]  is going to be phenomenal guys. Let me see show some love in the chat. Oh, I see it. I see you guys
[2002.40 --> 2011.04]  coming in. I'm seeing some mees. I'm seeing John, Rand Taylor, France, Francesca, Mindy, Javon,
[2011.04 --> 2016.08]  Palma, so many people. Okay, okay, I think you guys are ready for it. I won't hold it back. I won't hold
[2016.08 --> 2023.20]  it back. So without further ado, it's my pleasure to introduce you guys to Robert Green's
[2024.48 --> 2031.84]  exclusive master class, social mastery, the power of seeing people just as they
[2032.48 --> 2038.64]  are. Robert, I know you talked a lot about why, what this master class is about,
[2039.92 --> 2048.24]  can you just share any more insight on into why you decided to do it now and that this time
[2048.24 --> 2054.80]  versus like any other time in history or what makes it a now thing, what makes it so urgent?
[2055.92 --> 2061.36]  Well, people are progressively getting worse at it and I don't mean to be so judgmental
[2061.44 --> 2066.88]  because I know it, something that's affected me, but also I look at the emails that I receive
[2066.88 --> 2072.88]  people wanting advice. It's also based on my consulting work with people who are very powerful and
[2072.88 --> 2079.52]  very successful and I've noticed that in the world today, people are progressively getting worse
[2079.52 --> 2085.60]  and worse and worse in their social relationships, in their interactions. They are mistreating
[2085.68 --> 2092.08]  people, they are saying the wrong things, they are not getting, they're not interesting people
[2092.08 --> 2097.76]  in their own ideas and it's because we've become increasingly self absorbed in this world.
[2097.76 --> 2104.40]  We are too virtual, we're too wrapped up in our phones and being social is a skill.
[2105.04 --> 2111.60]  If you think about like a skill like shooting baskets, free throws or whatever, a three-point shot,
[2112.16 --> 2115.68]  if you do a thousand, just ten thousand shots, you'll get better at it.
[2116.24 --> 2123.12]  Well, being social, the skill is interacting with people, interacting with them in bars, going to
[2123.12 --> 2130.16]  markets and interacting with people, interacting with strangers in your office or on the street or whatever,
[2130.16 --> 2136.48]  over and over and over again. And that develops the skill, it develops and finds to sense the
[2136.48 --> 2143.36]  activity to other people. And it's like a great way that we have in our in our spirit.
[2143.36 --> 2148.88]  And the more we practice it, the more we become sensitive to other people to their moods,
[2148.88 --> 2154.96]  to their non-verbal behavior. But we are growing in sensitive, we're growing the opposite direction.
[2154.96 --> 2159.84]  And I'm very worried about it. So that's why I wrote the Laws of Human Nature.
[2159.84 --> 2164.72]  And that's why I crafted this masterclass to help you get out of the shell that we're all
[2164.72 --> 2168.80]  retreating into because of all of the technology around us.
[2169.60 --> 2176.08]  Yeah, I love that man. It's we're living in some interesting times. And I think it's time for us
[2176.08 --> 2182.00]  to take accountability and for our growth. And that's why I love what we've got cooking here.
[2182.00 --> 2188.16]  So you guys have heard since the beginning of the webinar, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[2188.16 --> 2193.12]  So let me just dive in and give you guys a sneak peek here. We have tons of,
[2193.20 --> 2199.20]  if we have tons of value here, this is lesson number one, this is understanding the laws of human
[2199.20 --> 2204.32]  nature. So there's going to be, I think there's six lessons in here that are combined.
[2204.32 --> 2209.84]  These are the trainings that Robert has done. We're going to be covering everything in there
[2209.84 --> 2215.12]  from non-verbal communication that was something that you talked about earlier, Robert, you
