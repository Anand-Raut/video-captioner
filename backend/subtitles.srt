1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
see it. There we go. There you are. All right, everybody wave high to Robert.

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:15,280
Okay. Awesome. Awesome. So, you ready to get started, Robert? You ready for this man? You

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:23,199
excited? Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I'm interested to see who's joining us in the chat today.

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:34,159
I see Zoro. I see Joey, Picks, Mindy, Nicholas, Tray, Erica. We have some really great people

5
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,840
here. And I hope you guys are excited because tonight we're going to be doing something

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,399
really special. So, tonight, as I said, we're going to be unlocking the secrets to social

7
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,960
mastery to allow you to discover how to read people at a higher level. And I want to open up with

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,799
our first question and we're going to bounce this over to you, Robert. Why is it so important

9
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,239
for us to understand the subject matter that we're going to be talking about today?

10
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, thank you for having me burning and thank you to everybody out there. I'm kind of

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
humble to see all these names from all these different places. It's pretty amazing.

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,599
Anyway, the reason I did this master class for mentor show is because from all my experience,

13
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:28,640
all of us humans, we suffer. We have pain in our lives. We have anxiety. We have tension.

14
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:35,439
We feel frustrated. But we often don't realize the source of our problems, the source of this

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,439
tension and the same anxiety and this pain. And I maintain that as a social animal, a lot of our

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,039
problems stem from the fact that we really, really don't truly understand the people around us.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
You could be married to the same person for 10, 20 years. And there's still things about them

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,760
that you don't understand. People are a mystery. They wear masks. They learn very early age.

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,240
How to hide certain things that they don't want other people to see. And so, I say let's

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
imagine, for instance, that you could see into the person that you're dealing with, you had

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,800
100% clarity about them. You could see them and understand them perfectly. Now, that is an

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,320
ideal and that is basically impossible. But that if we say that's like at 100%,

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,280
most of us are understanding of people is more in the area of four or five percent. We're very

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
self absorbed. We're locked in our phones. We're thinking of our own problems. We're not really

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
deeply engaging with people. We're not really looking at them. We're not really observing them.

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,320
And the point of the master class that I did the mentor show is to be it, to give you the

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,840
power to raise that up to 20, 30, 40, 50%. So you have the power to move people in the direction you

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,400
want. So that you don't say things that inadvertently insult people and cause all kinds of tensions

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,919
and problems that you don't inadvertently get yourself fired for doing things that are socially

30
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:12,159
awkward, etc. So that you realize that being a social animal is a skill and you raise that

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,479
skill to a high enough level where you don't have all of this drama in here. You don't have all of

32
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,960
this tension and you can focus on things that are actually truly important. So that is the point

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,240
of this master class that I created and of the mentor show and of what we're talking about today.

34
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,079
Awesome. Thank you so much Robert for sharing that. I just want to jump back to the presentation here.

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,080
And I want to share with you guys what we're going to be covering today as the agenda. So here's

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,240
what we're going to talk about and what you can expect. We're going to talk about how to see

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,680
through the mass people where we're going to talk about how to deal with toxic people. We're also

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,439
going to be talking about how to seduce an influence anyone, which is really cool. And this is probably

39
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,400
the most, I think this is what's got me most excited Robert. Is that you're going to be doing

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,759
a live Q&A with us here and that's just powerful man. Okay. I'm ready. Awesome. Okay. Cool. So a

41
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,600
couple of things housekeeping before we get into the content for the people who don't know what

52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,680
the housekeeping out of the way, let's talk about part one. Let's just really go into this and

53
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,280
talk about how to see through the mass. So I'm going to pop you up over here again and I'm going

54
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,199
to start with this question, Robert. Like what advice would you give someone who really wants to

55
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,960
understand people for who they really are, what they're really like? Well, the first step and the

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,920
most important one is to realize that you don't really understand people that you're misleading them.

57
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,000
And the thing that you tend to do is you tend to project your own emotions onto them. You tend to see

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,759
them through the lens of your own desires. You want you whether you like them or whether you don't like them.

59
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,920
And things that haven't in the past, your parents, your past relationships, all of the troubles

60
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,120
that you've had in life. And so when you're looking at this person that you're dealing with in your work,

61
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
in your relationships, even your children, you're projecting onto them, these images that are inside

62
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,079
your own head that have nothing to do with the reality. So the first step is to tell yourself,

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,680
I don't really understand this person that I'm dealing with. They are a meh, to me. So you want

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
to wipe the sleep clean and you want to try and observe them, but you have to be able to calm

65
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,720
all of your emotional responses down, even your desires to like a person. You have to stop that

66
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
and you have to try and find a neutral position where you're just observing them for who they are,

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,439
they have their own life, their own dreams, their own crumbs, their own faults. And you want to be

68
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:06,480
able to see them and you want to have access to them. The second thing you understand is that you

69
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:13,199
tend to judge people based on their appearances, how they look to you, what they say, you tend to

70
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,080
focus so much on their words, right? But we all know that words can be very slippery. People can say

71
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,519
whatever they want to say. They can say, I love your screenplay. I think your ideas are brilliant,

72
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,639
but they don't mean it at all. Anybody can say what they want. And so you tend to value the appearance

73
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,599
as you tend to value what you see and how people look, how people look and how they appear.

74
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,039
And this can be very tricky and very deceptive. So the most important thing that you can do is to

75
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,479
realize that the appearance, the surface, the faces that you see are not the reality.

76
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,800
Or hiding something. And so your task as a social being, as a social animal, trying to improve

77
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,800
your level of skill is to see past those appearances, see past those masks that people wear. And

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,919
one of the things you have to realize is that people have a character. They have something deep inside

79
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,839
that motivates them that makes them do the things that they do. And this character is in things

80
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,359
that they can't even control. It has to do with genetics, it has to do with their early childhood,

81
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:30,560
it has to do with things that are not visible to you. Right? So you want to judge them. And so

82
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,240
one thing that happens is when people are in stressful situations, for instance, that mask tends

83
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,399
to come off. And you see some of the true person behind that. How they handle stress,

84
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,639
reveals something about what's going on.

85
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,639
.

86
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,840
.

87
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,319
They're often hiding the exact opposite. They've developed from childhood, they desire to

88
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,200
hide the fact that they're actually very shy, they're very timid, they're very insecure.

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,760
And so they put on this front of being super confident. And actually the truth is the opposite.

90
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,560
So you want to be able to see these very overt traits that people have in realize that that is a mask

91
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,560
that happen are how to when people are given power, how do they handle that power?

92
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:48,159
Suddenly they become very mean-spirited, very cruel to other people. That's revealing who they

93
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,599
are behind the mask. As they're rising up in the company or wherever, they tend to be the court

94
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:59,519
chair, they be smiling and be friendly. And then as soon as they reach a position of power, that mask

95
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,039
comes off. And they reveal that they're actually somebody very different. The other thing you want to

96
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:13,679
see, which will reveal about people, who they are truly, is criticizing them. How do they take criticism?

97
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,919
A lot of people can't take criticism on any level. And you certainly don't want to ever hire people

98
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,240
or be in a relationship with people who cannot take any kind of criticism. That reveals

99
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,679
deep, deep levels of insecurity and anxiety. And so, but they're hiding it in some way. And so that

100
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,159
mask comes off when you criticize them. And they be taking things everything so personally. I know

101
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:47,199
when I was working, when I hire a systems, I often give them a test. And I try and criticize

102
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:53,279
that a work on some level and say, I don't do it meanly, I don't do it harshly, I do it gently, but I say,

103
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,639
you know, this is something that you're doing that's wrong. And how they respond to that reveals

104
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,959
to me, who they really are. They're trying to pretend they're something. They're trying to pretend

105
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,360
that they're very efficient that they love me, et cetera. But when I criticize them,

106
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,440
that mask tends to come off. So, these are some of the ways you can probe and test who people really are.

107
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,519
And in the master class that I did, I have many, many more ideas about how to pierce and see

108
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,519
behind these masks that people have. Yeah, that's, that's a super powerful one. I think that

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,160
anybody, by a show of hand, just by dropping guesses in the chat, like, have you guys

110
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,000
experience some of that, right? Like, have you seen how people respond, like, maybe a boss at work

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,279
or a colleague, as they're rising up the ranks, you know, they treat people better, you know,

112
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,079
like things like that, does anybody relate to that just by raising your hand? Because I know I can

113
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,279
rather than that's one of the things that stuck out to me. I would like to also kind of,

114
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,919
shift gears a little bit. And I think this is a good time to move into our next topic,

115
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,439
unless there's anything else that you wanted to cover there. But I'm just curious in the chat also,

116
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:16,079
like, when we're dealing with people in the world a lot of times, we come across these people that

117
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,000
may not be good people, right? Like, I think you define them as like toxic personalities, and that's what

118
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,959
we've defined them in society. Like, so I'd like to transition to, to that piece.

119
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,280
I mean, just jump back over here to the presentation because I think this is pretty powerful. And this is

120
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,320
this is where part two will come in ladies and gentlemen, and how to deal with these people,

121
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,759
because we're coming in contact with these people on a regular basis, Robert, and I think it would

122
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,560
be really helpful for the people in the audience to understand, you know, how to deal with them,

123
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,720
which brings me to my next question because in the master class, I know you talk about, just,

124
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,040
you talk about dealing with toxic personalities. So how do we recognize these types of people

125
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,480
in our everyday situations? Well, I have a very simple way of reading whether people are truly

126
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,800
toxic. Now, there's, let's say that there are toxic narcissists out there. We all have narcissistic

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,160
tendencies where all self-absorbed, but some people are toxic narcissists. There are people who

128
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,039
have toxic envy. We're all subject to feeling envy, but there's some people who carry to

129
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,319
it toxic level. Passive aggression is something we share, but there are people out there who are

130
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:39,759
toxicly passive aggressive. And the way that recognize them is simple, they tend to occupy

131
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:47,679
a lot of mental space in your head, thinking about them. They're churning up all of these emotions,

132
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:58,000
and most of these emotions are negative, fear, anxiety, resentment, frustration, confusion,

133
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,959
guilt. Occasionally, there might be a positive emotion put in there because sometimes these people

134
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,479
are good at playing push-and-plull games where they inject a little bit of affection to get you hooked,

135
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:16,799
then they pull back. But overall, you can recognize them by the fact that most of the emotions

136
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,399
they turn up are negative, and they absorb so much of your mental space so that when they're not

137
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,159
around when you're not dealing with them, you're thinking about them. And I compare the mind to

138
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,599
like a house. You've invited these people into your house and they won't leave. They're in your

139
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:40,000
bedroom, they're in your living room. They just take in residents, they're in your can't get rid of them.

140
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,240
Okay? So they're occupying your brain when you don't want them to. That's how you recognize

141
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,919
any kind of talks of person. But the most important thing for you to understand is

142
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,120
they're playing games to get you emotionally involved to trigger you, to get inside if you

143
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,560
to get you, to get their hooks in you. The best thing you can do is to recognize them

144
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,960
before they are able to do that, before they enter your house and take residents in your head.

145
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,320
If you can do that, then you can control your emotions. You can get rid of them, or you can

146
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,160
not have a relation with ship with them, or you can be relatively objective and unemotional in

147
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,400
dealing with them. But once they have their hooks in you, once that toxic narcissist has been

148
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,040
able to get inside of your life and get all these little dramas going on, it's very, very

149
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,840
difficult to disconnect. So the most important thing is to recognize them. And in the master class,

150
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,920
I give you some clues as to, for example, how do it see those toxic narcissists in our life?

151
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
I mean, I could talk about all the other types, but just to focus on the toxic narcissist,

152
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,600
which is the main type that we deal with, particularly in the world today. And the thing you must

153
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,000
understand is that a lot of toxic narcissists can rise to positions of power. And why is that?

154
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,720
Because you would think that because they're so self-absorbed, they would never be able to become

155
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,360
like a CEO. But people like Elon Musk and I'm not judging him as as a business person,

156
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:19,279
but he is very, very narcissistic and he's very, very powerful. The reason is these types of people

157
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,840
from early on in life have learned how to be very charming, how to be very dramatic. They're very

158
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,960
theatrical types of people. And you look at the surfaces I said earlier on, you get too much

159
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,840
wrapped up in people's appearance. They look dramatic. They look exciting. They look confident.

160
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
And then you get involved with them. You work for them. You have a relationship with them. And

161
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,840
slowly, you realize that they don't care at all about you. They're simply using you as a pond.

162
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,920
So some of the signs of a toxic narcissist is that they're as they're very theatrical. The other

163
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:04,240
sign is if you do something, if you insult them in some way, or if you say if you resist them in

164
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,319
some way, they go into what's called toxic rage. They cannot handle any kind of criticism because

165
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,599
they have this deep insecurity and emptiness inside. And so if you trigger any kind of negative

166
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,879
feeling on their part, they will explode into this rage. The other thing I tell people is we didn't

167
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:32,720
talk about non-verbal communication. And in the mentor class, the mentor show that I do, I focus a lot

168
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,440
a non-verbal communication because it's extremely revealing about people and about who they are.

169
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,680
And toxic narcissists, I, in my experience, have this one very common trait, which is when they're

170
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,280
looking at you, they appear to be interested in excited, but you'll notice that their eyes are kind

171
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,680
of dead. They're not really excited. They're not really interested in you. People who are interested

172
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,879
in you who like you, who love you, who want to be involved with you, who are not using you. Their

173
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:10,720
faces animated when they look at you, their eyes are open. But when you look at it at a toxic narcissist,

174
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,720
and I've noticed this time again, is their eyes kind of blank, it's kind of dead. They may smile,

175
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,839
but they're not really looking at you. They're looking at you as an object that they can use

176
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,439
for their own purposes. And so these are some of the powerful ways, but the most important thing

177
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:32,799
is to not get involved with these people, learn the basics of recognizing

178
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,879
envies, people, enviers tend to be among your friends. So one way of seeing a person who's got toxic

179
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:47,679
envies, they're in a rush to befriends you. You meet them and then three days later, they're

180
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,320
your best friend. They want to know everything about you. They're texting you all the time.

181
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,560
They love you. They think you're great. Now that's not a normal human pattern of behavior.

182
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,720
Most of us are kind of a little bit tentative when we first meet somebody. This is a classic sign of

183
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,039
somebody who's getting close to you in order to hurt you in order because they envy you in some way.

184
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,200
So in the class, I have many, many other more tips about how to recognize these people. So you

185
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,799
don't let them into your house before it's too late. Yeah, I was reflecting on it because I've

186
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,000
gone through the masterclass and I feel like you did an amazing job with identifying those people

187
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,840
because we're going to come up against them in a lot of times. We just can't avoid them.

188
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
We're going to come, we can't avoid not coming in contact with them, but this gives us a nice

189
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
framework to just figure out who they are and run in the other direction.

190
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:55,279
So I'm curious for the people in the audience, is there anyone who wants to learn how to build

191
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,920
better relationships, wants to learn how to influence people? Because I think this is a,

192
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,319
and just to kind of conclude Robert, I think from here, what I'm here and you say is like

193
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,720
recognize that the narcissist, they're, the root of how they grew up and they're upbringing

194
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,639
has taught them this way of manipulating people and they're, when they hook into you, you know,

195
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:23,759
they basically can, that's when they latch into you and they suck you dry and then the person who

196
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,799
envies you, they're trying to get close to you so they can manipulate you and do all that stuff.

197
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,559
Am I on the right track? Yes, we are. And the thing is, talks people,

198
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,799
don't wear a little sign on their head saying, I'm toxic. They've learned very early age to

199
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,639
hide it, to hide it behind of the near, of being charming, of being friendly, of being likable,

200
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:50,639
etc. And so it's very, very tricky because you can't recognize them, you can't find see them

201
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,960
just based on how they look at you based on their appearances. You have to be able to look

202
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:06,079
behind them and see the reality. Yeah, totally. So I want to go to our next segment here and part

203
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:14,400
three of this is how to seduce and influence anyone. And this is, I think this is pretty powerful because

204
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,039
you know, and I'd like to get your take on this because I think when people hear seduction,

205
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,799
they kind of like think of it as like a sexual thing or trying to coerce. But I know that you

206
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,359
there's more to this, right? And I'd like to dig into that. But this is part three. So we'll dive into

207
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:38,879
this. And let me just go back here to get you on the screen. But like let's talk about this, Robert.

208
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:46,480
So how can seduction and influence be used to get what we want? And how can people think about this

209
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,680
in a different way than it just being like this thing related to like sexual stuff? Well,

210
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,919
it is some of seduction is definitely sexual and I don't want to deny that. And I talked about that

211
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:07,119
a little bit in the mentor's class show. I mean, there are people we are situations where we do want

212
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,399
to seduce a man or a woman. So I don't want to run away from that. Sure. But seduction is much

213
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:18,799
larger than that. And the issue really is how to influence people, how to persuade them. You can't

214
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,480
get through this life. If you don't have the ability to somehow get people on your side to move

215
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,160
them to like your ideas, to want to move in your direction, to not hurt your harm you. And you

216
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,759
have to understand that people are naturally resistant to anything that you want from them.

217
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,200
They're even naturally resistant, obviously, in any kind of sexual seduction. And the whole

218
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,039
game is to lower their resistances, right? And people, particularly in the world today, I hate to judge,

219
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,799
are actually not very good at this. The main thing that you want to be able to be a better

220
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,839
seduce or to be a better influence or in life is the power to get outside of yourself. We are so

221
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,920
self absorbed and to the degree that you enter into the world, the mindset of that other person.

222
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,839
You get inside their skin, you understand their values, you understand how they think. And what they

223
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,599
want, you will have much greater power to move them in the direction that you want. You will be

224
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:27,119
able to lower their resistances. So I talk in the class about having deep levels of empathy,

225
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,240
where you actually enter their world completely and you understand where they're coming from.

226
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,039
And what their childhood was like and what were the traumas in their life, etc.

227
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,639
Creating that connection of deep levels of empathy will make the other person fall under your

228
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,640
spell and will create a very deep connection between you. The other thing I talk about is how to

229
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:56,000
validate their egos. We go through life and nobody. We think of ourselves as great usually,

230
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,440
we do unless we have very little empathy. Wow, I'm just a wonderful person. I'm so smart,

231
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,400
I have the best values, you know, on and on and on. But the true validation that we really create

232
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,480
comes from other people, other people telling us, yes, Robert, you are actually smart. Yes,

233
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,720
you are actually a good person. That is the validation people crave. You need to be able to give them

234
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,120
that validation to show them that you think that they are actually a really good person,

235
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,360
that they're even smarter than you are. Right? One of the laws of power and the 48 laws of power is

236
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:43,519
a pure, dumber than others, you know, and the idea that you're insulting people's intelligence

237
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:51,439
is incredibly dangerous and incredibly anti-seduction. So you want to validate people in the things

238
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:58,479
that matter most to them in their egos. And then you want to realize that how you look at people,

239
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,200
how your attitude is towards them, how you think about them, has an infecting power. If you go

240
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,279
up to somebody in a party or any kind of event like that and you're already thinking negative

241
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,880
thoughts about them or you're not insecure, they pick that up, they sense it, and they respond to

242
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,839
you in a defensive negative way. And I want to train you to go up to people even those that you

243
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:30,159
don't like and just tell yourself, actually I like you, actually I think you're an interesting

244
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,799
person. You don't say any of that, you just think it. You're attitude infects them with a particular

245
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,199
quality and it opens them up to you. So it's a very powerful technique. And finally, there comes

246
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:50,720
seduction and seduction is basically the ability to give people pleasure in life. None of us

247
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,079
in the world today because we're so politically correct because we're so tight in our bodies.

248
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:02,079
We don't have enough pleasure. We don't have enough adventure. We're actually craving seduction.

249
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,680
People may not say that, they may say, oh seduction is evil. Or Robert Green is evil.

250
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,759
Oh, the art of seduction is a bad book. But secretly, they want it, they crave it because all of us

251
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,360
want to be taken out of ourselves. We want to be taken on the adventure. And so you have to be able,

252
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:26,559
so you have to understand that that is the power that you have. But what I talk about in that

253
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,759
and that particular segment is if you two obvious, if it's too clear that you're trying to

254
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:38,159
seduce people, if you two cold and manipulative, they can sense it. So you have to disguise yourself.

255
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:45,359
You have to peer natural. It can bake. It has to actually be something, but everybody has seductive

256
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:52,479
qualities. And so the idea is you want to be a seduce or in life. And you want to be able to seduce

257
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:58,079
people even in the office, whether it's an absolutely no sexual element to them. But the sense

258
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:04,879
that you're a charming person, that you like them, and that you are to know you,

259
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:09,919
is going to be an exciting adventure that there's some mystery about you being a seduction.

260
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,560
It involves a lot of creating mystery. It's very, very powerful. So just imagine if this way,

261
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,480
you're dealing with people on all levels and you're lowering their resistance, you're lowering

262
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,920
their defensiveness. They have walls and you're breaking through those walls and they're falling

263
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,720
under your spell. And that's what I'm discussing in that part of the mentor show and go into great

264
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,839
depth. Yeah. And this is super powerful for me, Robert, because being an entrepreneur,

265
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,279
you have to go out and you have to sell. So part of, I look at the seduction as the stuff that I've

266
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,079
learned from you, I look at me seducing someone is like, that's making the sale. It's getting them

267
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,160
to buy into my ideas and to even want a sales call. I'm going in and I have to lower their resistance.

268
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,240
Right. So that to me, that's how I think about seduction. Would you say that's in line?

269
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,440
Yes, very much. So just think of it this way. To the degree that you enter into their world,

270
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,040
that you think of their needs, their interests, their desires, you become a much better sales person

271
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,360
on any level. And whether it's in personal relationships or whatever. But the worst kind of sales

272
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,320
mirror those that have their own kind of speel in their head and they're thinking about how great

273
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,559
their product is and they're trying to sell it to you. And you're just like, man, I don't

274
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,960
I don't want to hear you tune them out because we hear so many people trying to sell those things.

275
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,079
But if they think it through and they go, this is an individual I'm dealing with.

276
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,399
This is some of their needs, their world, their problems. I'm going to appeal to their self-interest.

277
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,439
I'm going to appeal to what they need in life. Suddenly, doors open up. I know personally,

278
00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:01,600
for instance, in my own life, I never, ever have enough time. I'm so busy and it drives me crazy.

279
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:10,160
If somebody entered my life, somehow promising the prospect of saving me time, I would melt in front

280
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,600
of them. The way it's to sell me, whatever it is, right? But people come to me and they don't think

281
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,559
that that's, you know, I get requests all of the time where people want to be my apprentice,

282
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,440
it's said, you know, any kind of function with me or partner with me, they don't think of that.

283
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,599
They don't realize how busy I am, but everybody is super busy. So being able to pierce inside the

284
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,759
world of the other person to go, what is their need? Not my need, what is their need? What are their

285
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,799
secret desires? That is the secret to any kind of sale or any kind of seduction.

286
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,519
Love it. Powerful. I think speaking of these, I think this is a perfect time to transition to talk

287
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,359
about the master class and how it could help our audience here at a deeper level. And

288
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,480
in everyone, I'm acknowledging, I want to acknowledge that I see a lot of questions in the chat and

289
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,919
make sure you guys keep putting those in the chat. We're going to feel those at the end. For those of

290
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,159
you who didn't hear at the beginning, Robert's going to stick around and do a Q&A. So you'll

291
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,800
guys will want to make sure you stay to the very end. So put all those questions there. Quick

292
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,880
question for you, Robert. I know we talked about a lot and we're covering a lot here. And, you know,

293
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,120
there's probably people that want to go deeper, right? If people want this stuff to sink in,

294
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,960
how can your master class really help us get to the root and really make this a practice for us?

295
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,200
Well, a lot of what's in this master class is based on the laws of human nature,

296
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,799
which you've you delved into, it is a 580 page book. It's very dense. Okay, I have tried to

297
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,200
simplify it on some level and give you the basic ideas that are contained in that book.

298
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
Very concentrated. It's like a straight shot of whiskey that I'm giving you. There's no one.

299
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,000
Ice, it's just the whiskey. So you're getting the straight material right there. And I'm trying

300
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,240
to make it very practical. It's not abstract. It's not me intellectualizing and going on and on about

301
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,640
psychology. It's about your life, the problems that you're dealing with. And so I'm trying to train

302
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,519
you in this art of dealing with people on a higher level. I have exercises, which is something that I didn't

303
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,920
have in laws of human nature. I worked very, very hard to put this mentor show together. I put a

304
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:41,759
lot of thought in it. And I thought of exercises that can help you realize these ideas in your own life.

305
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,680
You know, how to observe people in your everyday life exercise about that, how to control your

306
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,360
emotions so that talks that people don't get under your skin, how to alter the people that you're

307
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,560
dealing with through your attitude, through how you think of them on and on. So these exercises are

308
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,559
very focused. It's a very focused mentor, class, ship, class on how to understand people and deal

309
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:13,839
with them in great detail. Okay. So there's not a lot of abstract stuff. There are stories in there,

310
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:20,079
but the stories are a lot of it for my own life or from a couple of stories in the laws of human

311
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,279
nature, but they're very direct and they're very applicable and they're very relevant. So it's a

312
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:33,119
extremely practical show. I personally believe that combined with the laws of human nature,

313
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,839
reading the book and doing the master class, it will really benefit the most. But that is the idea

314
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:46,960
behind my what I craft for this. Beautiful. Man, I'm going to need the help of everybody in the audience

315
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,639
today. I want you guys to get super hyped for this one because we have something amazingly special

316
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,480
for you guys today. So just by show a hand in the chat right now, I want you guys to tell me

317
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,880

319
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,400

321
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,080
Palma, so many people. Okay, okay, I think you guys are ready for it. I won't hold it back. I won't hold

322
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,200
it back. So without further ado, it's my pleasure to introduce you guys to Robert Green's

323
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,840
exclusive master class, social mastery, the power of seeing people just as they

324
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,640
are. Robert, I know you talked a lot about why, what this master class is about,

325
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:08,240
can you just share any more insight on into why you decided to do it now and that this time

326
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,800
versus like any other time in history or what makes it a now thing, what makes it so urgent?

327
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,360
Well, people are progressively getting worse at it and I don't mean to be so judgmental

328
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,880
because I know it, something that's affected me, but also I look at the emails that I receive

329
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,880
people wanting advice. It's also based on my consulting work with people who are very powerful and

330
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,519
very successful and I've noticed that in the world today, people are progressively getting worse

331
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:45,599
and worse and worse in their social relationships, in their interactions. They are mistreating

332
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,079
people, they are saying the wrong things, they are not getting, they're not interesting people

333
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,759
in their own ideas and it's because we've become increasingly self absorbed in this world.

334
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:04,400
We are too virtual, we're too wrapped up in our phones and being social is a skill.

335
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:11,599
If you think about like a skill like shooting baskets, free throws or whatever, a three-point shot,

336
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,679
if you do a thousand, just ten thousand shots, you'll get better at it.

337
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:23,119
Well, being social, the skill is interacting with people, interacting with them in bars, going to

338
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,159
markets and interacting with people, interacting with strangers in your office or on the street or whatever,

339
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:36,480
over and over and over again. And that develops the skill, it develops and finds to sense the

340
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,360
activity to other people. And it's like a great way that we have in our in our spirit.

341
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,880
And the more we practice it, the more we become sensitive to other people to their moods,

342
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,960
to their non-verbal behavior. But we are growing in sensitive, we're growing the opposite direction.

343
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,840
And I'm very worried about it. So that's why I wrote the Laws of Human Nature.

344
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,719
And that's why I crafted this masterclass to help you get out of the shell that we're all

345
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,799
retreating into because of all of the technology around us.

346
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,079
Yeah, I love that man. It's we're living in some interesting times. And I think it's time for us

347
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,000
to take accountability and for our growth. And that's why I love what we've got cooking here.

348
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,159
So you guys have heard since the beginning of the webinar, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

349
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,119
So let me just dive in and give you guys a sneak peek here. We have tons of,

350
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:39,199
if we have tons of value here, this is lesson number one, this is understanding the laws of human

351
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,319
nature. So there's going to be, I think there's six lessons in here that are combined.

352
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,839
These are the trainings that Robert has done. We're going to be covering everything in there

353
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,119
from non-verbal communication that was something that you talked about earlier, Robert, you
